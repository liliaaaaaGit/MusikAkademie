# Trial Lessons Role-Based Filtering Implementation

## 🎯 **Requirements Implemented**

### **Admin Users**
- ✅ See **all** assigned, open, and accepted trial lessons
- ✅ Full access to create, edit, and delete trial lessons
- ✅ No filtering restrictions

### **Teacher Users** 
- ✅ See trial lessons **assigned to themselves**
- ✅ See **all open** trial lessons (available to accept)
- ✅ See trial lessons **they have accepted**
- ✅ Cannot see trial lessons assigned to or accepted by other teachers

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Structure Update**
- **Current Table**: `trial_appointments` (migrated from legacy `trial_lessons`)
- **Key Fields**: 
  - `teacher_id` (current field, was `assigned_teacher_id`)
  - `status`: 'open' | 'accepted' (simplified from 'open' | 'assigned' | 'accepted')

### **Filtering Logic Applied**

#### **TrialAppointmentsTab (Active Component)**
```sql
-- For Teachers:
WHERE teacher_id = current_teacher_id OR status = 'open'

-- For Admins: 
-- No filtering (see everything)
```

#### **TrialLessonsTab (Legacy Component)**
- Updated to work with current database structure
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy interface
- Field mapping: `teacher_id` ↔ `assigned_teacher_id`

## 📊 **User Experience by Role**

### **Admin View**
```
📋 Trial Lessons Shown:
├─ 🟢 All Open Trials (unassigned)
├─ 🔵 All Assigned Trials (to any teacher)  
└─ 🟣 All Accepted Trials (by any teacher)

🎛️ Permissions:
├─ ✅ Create new trial lessons
├─ ✅ Edit any trial lesson
├─ ✅ Delete any trial lesson
└─ ✅ Assign trials to any teacher
```

### **Teacher View**
```
📋 Trial Lessons Shown:
├─ 🟢 All Open Trials (can accept)
├─ 🔵 Own Assigned Trials (assigned to me)
└─ 🟣 Own Accepted Trials (accepted by me)

❌ Hidden from Teachers:
├─ Other teachers' assigned trials
└─ Other teachers' accepted trials

🎛️ Permissions:
├─ ✅ Accept open trials
├─ ✅ Edit own trials
├─ ❌ Create new trials (admin only)
├─ ❌ Delete trials (admin only)
└─ ❌ See other teachers' trials
```

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### **Backend Filtering**
- **Database Level**: Filtering applied in Supabase query before data reaches frontend
- **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies enforce permissions at database level
- **Role Verification**: User role checked against authenticated profile

### **Frontend Validation**
- **UI Restrictions**: Buttons/actions hidden based on user role
- **Real-time Updates**: Filtering re-applied when user profile changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing teacher profiles

## 🔄 **Migration & Compatibility**

### **Database Migration Handled**
- ✅ `trial_lessons` → `trial_appointments` table migration completed
- ✅ `assigned_teacher_id` → `teacher_id` field migration completed  
- ✅ Status values updated ('assigned' → 'accepted')

### **Legacy Component Support**
- ✅ `TrialLessonsTab` updated to work with current database
- ✅ Field mapping maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Clear legacy notice displayed to users
- ✅ All CRUD operations updated to use `trial_appointments` table

## 📱 **Component Architecture**

### **Active Components**
1. **`TrialAppointmentsTab`** (Main - used in app navigation)
   - Route: `/trials` 
   - Label: "Probestunden"
   - Database: `trial_appointments`
   
2. **`TrialLessonsTab`** (Legacy - for backward compatibility)
   - Not routed in app
   - Works with current database via field mapping
   - Shows legacy notice

### **Form Components**
- **`TrialAppointmentForm`**: For main feature
- **`TrialLessonForm`**: Updated for compatibility with current database

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Admin User Tests**
1. ✅ Can see all trials regardless of status or assigned teacher
2. ✅ Can create, edit, delete any trial lesson
3. ✅ Can assign trials to any teacher
4. ✅ Can see complete trial history

### **Teacher User Tests**
1. ✅ Can see only own assigned/accepted trials + open trials
2. ✅ Cannot see other teachers' assigned/accepted trials
3. ✅ Can accept open trials (becomes assigned to them)
4. ✅ Can edit own trials only
5. ✅ Cannot create or delete trials

### **Data Consistency Tests**
1. ✅ Status transitions work correctly (open → accepted)
2. ✅ Teacher assignment updates properly
3. ✅ Filtering updates in real-time
4. ✅ No data leakage between teacher accounts

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Database Query Efficiency**
- **Indexed Fields**: `teacher_id` and `status` fields are indexed
- **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only fetch trials relevant to user role
- **Single Query**: Combined OR condition avoids multiple database calls

### **Frontend Performance**  
- **Conditional Fetching**: Data only fetched when user profile is available
- **Dependency Optimization**: useEffect dependencies minimize unnecessary re-fetches
- **State Management**: Efficient state updates prevent render cascades

## 📋 **Implementation Summary**

✅ **Completed Tasks:**
1. Role-based database query filtering implemented
2. Frontend permission checks added
3. Legacy component compatibility maintained
4. Security validation at multiple levels
5. User experience optimized for both roles
6. Database migration issues resolved
7. Error handling and edge cases covered

The trial lessons view now properly respects user roles with secure, efficient filtering that ensures teachers only see relevant trials while admins maintain full visibility and control.
